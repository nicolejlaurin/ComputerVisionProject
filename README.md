## Summary: 
Our project will be focusing on developing a face recognition program to improve overall personal security. The goal is to make use of machine learning algorithms in order to explore and learn the many features of human faces. Through the implementation of such a program, we will be able to detect and match faces accordingly.


## Background:
If your ideas coming from existing research you should refer to the publications and describe what you are doing differently.

Notes: If your project involves taking advantage of computational speedups available on your iOS device - such as box filters, inverse composition in the
LK algorithm, NEON intrinsics, OpenGL ES, Accelerate Framework, binary descriptors such as FAST and BRIEF, etc. - describe their application and why
they are necessary in more detail. If your project involves something around using your device in a mobile fashion - for example virtually rendering an object 
in your room - then describe what components of your solution are unique to a mobile device (the high-speed camera, GPS, IMU, Gyro?).

## The Challenge: 
Describe in a few sentences why the problem is challenging. Could you solve your problem using just a few pre-existing functions in
OpenCV? Try to state explicitly what you are hoping to learn by doing this project? A flow chart or visual depiction of what you are trying to do would be
good here.

## Goals and Deliverables: 
Describe the deliverables or goals of your project.

• In a couple of sentences separate your goals into what you PLAN TO ACHIEVE (what you believe you must get done to have a successful project and get the grade you expect) 
and an extra goal or two that you HOPE TO ACHIEVE if the project goes really well and you get ahead of schedule.

• Describe what success looks like and how it can be evaluated. For example, if your project is to measure the velocity of a baseball being thrown in front
of an iOS device, how will you validate that it works? Screen shots of the App in action? A speed benchmark run across a variety of videos? A live
video of the app in action? It will NOT be enough to simply provide the Xcode project - you will need to provide evidence that you have achieved your goal.
• How realistic is it for your team to get what it needs to get done within the allotted time
